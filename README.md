# Digital-Clock

Digital Clock using React.js
In this project I have used jsx, js and css file.
Time is fetched from the system's clock. 
By using the function setInterval(), the time gets updated automatically for every second.

The comments along with the code is present in the "src" folder.
App.jsx is the React page code.
Index.js is the parent node whose child node is App.jsx.
App.css is the stylesheet.
